"""Background delivery worker for the webhook_jobs queue (webhooks.py's
enqueue_delivery() writes to it, models.py's WebhookJob defines it). Runs
as its own long-lived process (see scripts/webhook_worker.py), separate
from the request/response cycle - the whole reason this exists is so a
slow or dead receiver can never add latency to POST /records/upload (see
main.py's comment on why that route uses run_in_threadpool for the CSV/DB
work that's still done inline).

ponytail: claims one job at a time (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 1, committed before claiming the next) rather than batching the
claim query - a batched claim would hold every claimed row's lock only
until the *first* job's own commit, silently letting a second worker
process claim the rest of the "still in progress" batch. One-at-a-time
costs an extra round trip per job; worth it for correctness at this
project's throughput. Move to a two-phase claim (mark 'processing' +
commit, then deliver, then commit the final status) if this ever needs
to batch for real throughput."""
