"""Outbound webhook delivery. A failed delivery must never fail the ingest
request that triggered it - the record is already safely persisted by the
time we attempt to notify anyone, so a network blip on the receiving end is
the receiver's problem to retry, not a reason to roll back real data.

Two delivery paths, both ending in deliver_attempt() below:
- Automatic (post-ingest): ingest.py calls enqueue_delivery() to create a
  WebhookJob row; webhook_worker.py's process_due_jobs() claims and
  delivers it later, off the request path, with retries scheduled via
  the job's own available_at (see WebhookJob in models.py).
- Manual replay (POST /records/{id}/webhooks/replay, main.py):
  notify_new_record() runs its own retry loop synchronously, in the
  request - a human asking for an immediate resend, not queued work.

Both paths persist one WebhookDelivery row per attempt, so the audit
trail shows the full retry history either way."""
