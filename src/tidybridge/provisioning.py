"""Outbound user provisioning: after a record is ingested, actually
create the corresponding user on a configured downstream system via a
SCIM-shaped POST /Users, instead of only notifying that it exists (see
webhooks.py). Same two-path shape as webhooks.py:
- Automatic (post-ingest): ingest.py calls enqueue_provisioning() to
  create a ProvisioningJob row; webhook_worker.py's
  process_due_provisioning_jobs() claims and delivers it later.
- Manual replay (POST /records/{id}/provisioning/replay, main.py):
  replay_provisioning() resets/creates the job row for the worker to
  pick up - unlike webhooks.py's notify_new_record(), this doesn't run
  its own synchronous retry loop (see the plan's clarification #4).

Every attempt persists one ProvisioningAttempt row, same audit-trail
principle as WebhookDelivery."""
