"""Ingestion pipeline: take an uploaded file, clean it via tidycsv, persist
the results, and trigger a webhook for each newly inserted record.

Note on reusing tidycsv's lower-level functions instead of its `clean()`
convenience wrapper: `clean()` returns `clean_df` with its index reset to
0..N-1 after deduplication, while `result.issues` still carries each issue's
*original* row_index from before dedup. That's fine for tidycsv's own CLI,
which only ever prints `row_index` as a label for a human to cross-reference
against their source file - it never needs to align an issue back to a
specific row of `clean_df` programmatically. This service does need that
alignment (to know which persisted record `has_issues`), so it calls
`coerce_and_validate` and `flag_duplicates` directly instead of `clean()`:
`flag_duplicates` does not reset the index, so the surviving rows keep their
original position and can be matched against `issues` directly."""
