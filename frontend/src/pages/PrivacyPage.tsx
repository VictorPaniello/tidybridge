        <p>
          tidybridge is an independent project built and operated by Victor Paniello, based in
          Barcelona, Spain. There is no separate registered company - Victor is the data
          controller (and, for the client data you upload, your data processor - see below) for
          personal data processed through this service.
        </p>

      </Section>

      <Section title="What data this service collects, and why">
        <p>There are two different kinds of personal data here, and they're treated differently.</p>

        <h3 className="font-medium mt-4 mb-1">1. Your own account data</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Email address (required) - to identify your account and log you in.</li>
          <li>
            First and last name (required for email+password signup; a GitHub sign-in only
            provides these once you complete your profile) - shown back to you in the app.
          </li>
          <li>Phone number (optional) - not currently used for anything besides storage on your profile.</li>
          <li>
            A hashed password (email+password accounts only) - your actual password is never
            stored, only a one-way hash of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you sign in with GitHub: your GitHub account ID and the email GitHub reports for
            it, plus an OAuth access/refresh token, stored so the linked login keeps working.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Legal basis:</strong> performance of the contract you enter into by creating an
          account (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR), and your consent for GitHub OAuth specifically, since it's
          an optional login method you choose to use.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium mt-4 mb-1">2. Data you upload about your own clients</h3>
        <p>
          The core purpose of this tool is letting you upload a CSV/Excel export of your own
          clients and have it cleaned and stored. That export can contain your clients' name,
          email, phone, signup date, and a monetary amount - real personal data about real people
          who never interacted with tidybridge directly and have no account here.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          You can also upload supplier invoices as a PDF or image. The supplier's name, tax ID
          (for a self-employed supplier, that's their personal tax ID number), invoice number,
          date, and amounts are read from the document and stored the same way.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>For this data, you are the controller, not tidybridge.</strong> By uploading a
          file, you confirm you have a lawful basis of your own (a contract with that client, their
          consent, or another valid basis under applicable law) to process and share their data
          this way. tidybridge acts as your <strong>data processor</strong> for this category only
          - storing and, if you configure a webhook, forwarding it on your behalf, on your
          instructions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium mt-4 mb-1">3. Technical data</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>
            A login token and your light/dark theme preference, stored in your browser's
            localStorage - never sent to tidybridge except as the token itself, on requests you
            make.
          </li>
          <li>
            One cookie, set only if you use "Sign in with GitHub": a short-lived, first-party CSRF
            token needed to complete that login securely. It isn't used for tracking and doesn't
            persist beyond the login flow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Nothing here is used for advertising, analytics, or tracking - there is no analytics
          script, tracking pixel, or third-party embed on this site to opt out of, because none
          exists.

        <p>The services this project depends on, each only for what they're named for:</p>

          <li>
            <strong>Resend</strong> - sends the "forgot password" email, if you request one. This
            means your email address, and the reset link, passes through Resend's systems (based
            in the United States) to reach your inbox. See{" "}

          <li>
            <strong>Anthropic</strong> - if you upload an invoice as a PDF or image, the document
            is sent to Anthropic's API (based in the United States) to read its fields. Anthropic
            processes it on tidybridge's behalf as a sub-processor and doesn't use it to train its
            models. CSV and Excel uploads never leave tidybridge's own servers. See{" "}

            <strong>Railway</strong> and <strong>Vercel</strong> - host the backend/database and
            the frontend, respectively. Standard infrastructure providers; they don't receive your

            <strong>A webhook URL you configure yourself</strong> (optional, self-hosted setups
            only) - if set, the data of each newly-ingested client record is sent there. This is
            your own destination, under your own control, not a tidybridge-operated third party.

      <Section title="How long data is kept">
        <p>
          <strong>Client data</strong> - what you upload about your own clients - is kept for up to{" "}
          <strong>one year</strong> after it's ingested, then deleted automatically by a scheduled
          job. This isn't just a policy statement; it's a real, tested, scheduled process that
          actually deletes the data - see the project's own README for the technical detail. You
          can also delete an individual client record yourself at any time, sooner than that, from
          the records list.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Your own account</strong> (email, name, phone, password) is different: it's kept
          for as long as you want it, with no automatic expiry, until you delete it yourself from{" "}

            Account settings
          </Link>
          . Deleting your account also immediately erases every client record it owns, rather than
          waiting out the one-year window.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Database backups are retained separately for up to 30 days for disaster-recovery
          purposes only (protecting against a bad migration or accidental deletion, not a
          substitute for this policy) - see the project's own README for that mechanism.
