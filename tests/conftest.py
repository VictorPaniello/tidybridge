    per-test. create_all() only ever creates *missing* tables; it silently
    leaves an existing table's columns stale on a schema change, which is
    exactly what caused two real bugs earlier in this project (see
    CHANGELOG) - a create_all()-based suite couldn't have caught either
    one, only actually running the migrations would have. CI's Postgres
    service container starts empty every run, so this always exercises the
    full chain there, not just "head applies cleanly on top of whatever
    was already there."
